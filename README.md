# California-Housing-Price-Prediction-with-ANN
demonstrates the implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for regression using the California Housing dataset. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation for predicting housing prices. 
Content

This notebook implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to solve a regression problem using the California Housing dataset from scikit-learn. The goal is to predict house prices based on various features, with a focus on data preprocessing, ANN structuring, and evaluation metrics.



Objective: Build and evaluate an ANN for regression to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset.



Dataset: California Housing dataset from scikit-learn.



Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow.



Steps:





Load and preprocess the California Housing dataset.



Split the data into training and test sets.



Scale features using StandardScaler.



Convert data to a DataFrame for visualization.



Check for GPU availability for TensorFlow.



Evaluation Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), RÂ² Score.



Key Concepts: ANN structure, ReLU activation, Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.

Usage





Ensure you have the required libraries installed: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow.



Run the notebook in an environment with Jupyter support (e.g., Google Colab, JupyterLab).



For GPU acceleration, ensure a compatible GPU and TensorFlow-GPU are installed.



Execute the cells sequentially to load, preprocess, and visualize the data.

Notes





The notebook is designed to run on systems with or without GPU support.



The California Housing dataset is fetched directly from scikit-learn.



Further sections (not shown in the provided document) likely include model training and evaluation, which can be extended as needed
